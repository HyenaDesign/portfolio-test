            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Frenzy started off as a side project just for fun. I was bored and had a lot of inspiration in my head for designing a platform.
                For the record, I did not finish the project since I had a lot of work at school. But it's basically an esports app. The whole
                idea was to have an app to host or join esports tournaments with friends or random gamers.

            <h2>DISCOVERY PHASE</h2>
            <p>I started on Frenzy like I start all my projects; watch videos about color theory and simple design methods. It helps me build up
                an idea on how far I can take the design of a certain project. Then I took a look at similar existing platforms. One of them stood
                out the most. And that is Kayzr. Kayzr is basically what I wanted to make but with many flaws. I'll have a link to it so you can
                take a look.

                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>I didn't do a lot of research for this project since I've recycled the functions of other platforms like this and made them slightly better.
                    But I did do some research on how I can create a logo that speaks "esports". Quickly I discovered that most of the competitive games are FPS.
                That made me rethink a lot of ideas for the logo and the branding in total. But that's basically it for the research since the most things just
            came up in my head.</p>

                <h2>CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p>I didn't really have a process here. I just randomly came up with a whole concept so here it is.<br><br>
                    Frenzy is a mobile & desktop platform where you and your friends can host and/or join esports tournaments.
                You can create your own seperate team or join other teams. The tournaments are divided up in leagues.
            Some are higher level whilst some are for beginning esports players. You can choose which game you play and even
        come up with your own set of rules.<br><br>Chats are monitored and innapropriate content is filtered or censored. Disrespectful
    behaviour leads to sanctions like time-outs or even bans. Because we're all about a respectful and fun community.</p>
